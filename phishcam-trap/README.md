# PhishCam Trap â€“ Webcam Awareness Simulation

This project simulates a fake "Are you 18+?" prompt that tricks users into granting webcam access. It's designed **for cybersecurity awareness**, to show how social engineering can manipulate users into allowing dangerous permissions.

##  How It Works

- The site asks "Are you 18 or older?"
- If the user clicks "Yes", the browser requests webcam access.
- After 5 seconds, a warning message appears: **"This was a simulation!"**
